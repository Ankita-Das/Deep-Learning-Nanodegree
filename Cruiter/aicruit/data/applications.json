I have worked on various technologies - mostly in python and deep learning and have experience working as an intern in IIT Patna(where I worked on NLP) and Jadavpur University(where I worked on Computer Vision). Other than that, I have prior experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C and various other technologies (SQL, Keras, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Git etc.). I have also researched under Prof. Swalpa Kumar Roy, under whom I worked on a journal ('Spectral-Spatial Bilinear 3D and 2D CNN Feature Fusion for Hyperspectral Image Classification', Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, IEEE), which is currently under review. Now, I am seeking for opportunities (as full time / intern) to work in your company, which I consider will be a significant experience for me. "}}]
